# 99_bottles_of_beer

"99 Bottles of Beer" is an anonymous folk song dating to the mid-20th century. It is a traditional reverse counting song in both the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize and can take a long time to sing.

# Created the 99 bottles of beer song in the form of a sinatra web application.

- When a user click the link "Take one down" - It deducts the number from backwards minus 1 (eg: 99 goes to 98).
- When a user reaches the "Take one down" = number as 0 bottles of beer on the wall - It changes it to "Start Over Man!!" and displays "No bottles of beer on the wall.
- You and click the link "Start Over Man!!" - It will start from "99 bottles of beer on the wall!!" as display.
